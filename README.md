# Immersing in the Sphere World

## Description

A new media art project about creating an immersive experience of becoming a sphere among spheres using VR and a Zorb ball.

A person (the "viewer") inside the Zorb ball experiences the VR using Google Daydream.  Their experienced orientation in VR changes with the orientation of the ball.  The ball is pushed by "pushers" that push the ball according to the will of the viewer.  

This project was created under the Frank-Ratchye Fund for Art @ the Frontier and Small Undergraduate Research Grant/Crosswalk by Carnegie Mellon University.  I created it as a first year during my time at CMU and with help from the STUDIO for Creative Inquiry and my friends.

## Materials

Created using Unity 2017.3.1.  Other materials include:
- Google Daydream + controller 
- Android phone with >= Nougat
- Electronics combining Arduino UNO with HC-06 and MPU-6050.
- A Zorb ball with handmade straps

## How To Use

Given that these materials are not readily available, the provided Unity project will show the VR and associated code being simulated on a laptop (mine was Windows 10).

After git cloning and opening the project in Unity 2017.3.1, open Assets > Scenes > sphereworld6.unity.  Press play, and the main scene should run.

The other scene, readButtons.unity, is the utility the "person-controller" uses.   The person-controller tell the pushers which direction to move the ball in physical space according to the desires of the viewer, who sees in VR space.
